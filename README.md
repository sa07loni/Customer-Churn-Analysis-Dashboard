The dashboard is particularly beneficial for customer success teams, marketing analysts, and business decision-makers, helping them devise data-backed strategies to minimize churn. By identifying the primary causes of customer attrition—such as poor service experience, pricing issues, or lack of engagement—businesses can implement targeted retention strategies, such as loyalty programs or personalized marketing campaigns.
